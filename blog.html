        <h4>Personal Needs</h4>
            <p>Anywhere you go, exotic shorthair cats will be content living there. They don't give much thought to square footage because they are primarily concerned about their owners. These cats are an easy-care breed that doesn't need a lot of room and will be content in either an apartment or a large house. If you travel frequently, it's a good idea to provide your exotic shorthair cat engaging toys and possibly even a playmate because social cats don't like being alone too much A cat tree is a terrific technique to keep exotic shorthair cats stimulated because they are a breed that is moderately active. They enjoy toys as well, so offer a variety, perhaps rotating them every few weeks to keep your cat from becoming bored. Your exotic shorthair cat will also like having at least one padded window perch where they can observe the outside world and chatter at birds, much like the majority of breeds. Additionally, you can provide them a cat bed of their own, but given how affectionate cats are, it's more probable that your exotic shorthair will choose to sleep close to you.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Health Of The Exotic Shorthair Cat Breed</h4>
        <p>Exotic shorthairs are generally a healthy breed overall. But because they and Persian cats share so much genetic material, they can experience some of the same health problems. These include polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), both of which affect the heart (PKD). By getting your kitten from a reliable exotic shorthair breeder, the majority of these issues can be somewhat avoided. According to Bonk, exotic shorthairs sometimes experience respiratory problems because of their flat noses, just like Persian cats. This is a particular issue with cats whose faces have been selectively bred to be extremely flat. Before purchasing a cat, it's crucial to speak with the breeder to ensure that your new exotic shorthair kitten will be able to breathe correctly throughout its life. Exotic shorthairs are particularly susceptible to obesity, which can exacerbate their respiratory problems. For this reason, it's crucial to monitor your cat's nutrition and get advice from your vet on how much and how frequently to feed your pet.</p>
